In feature classification, we extract training samples based on the extent of each individual feature defined by the feature class. For each training sample, there is an associated class label that comes from the feature class attribute table. Optionally, we can also define a buffer size to extract a larger neighbourhood around the feature so that more spatial context is available to the classification model, which makes distinguishing different classes easier."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["<center><img src=\"../../static/img/feature_classify_example.png\" height=\"700\" width=\"700\"></center>\n", "<center>Figure 1.
