Tabular data can be any vector data in the form of a [feature layer](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/working-with-feature-layers-and-features/) or [spatially enabled dataframe](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/introduction-to-the-spatially-enabled-dataframe/). Explanatory variables can take the form of fields in the attribute table of the feature layer, raster datasets, or distance features used to calculate proximity values for use as additional variables. In addition to validation of model performance based on the training data, predictions can be made to produce either features or a prediction raster.  Predictions can be performed for both categorical variables and continuous variables.\n",

Distances will be calculated from each of the input explanatory distance features to the nearest Input training features. If the input `distance_features` are polygons or lines, the distance attributes are calculated as the distance between the closest segments of the pair of features. However, distances are calculated differently for polygons and lines.

Comparing the predicted values with the actual target variable will give some indication of the performance of the trained model.
