    "\n",
    "Our state contains 8 variables; `(u,v,a,h,u’,v’,a’,h’)` where `(u,v)` are centres of the bounding boxes, a is the aspect ratio and h, the height of the image. The other variables are the respective velocities of the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Kalman Filter is used on every bounding box, so it comes after a box has been matched with a tracker. When the association is made, predict and update functions are called. \n",
