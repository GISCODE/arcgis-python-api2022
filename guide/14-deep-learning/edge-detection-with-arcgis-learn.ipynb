As a human, we can easily identify the edges and object boundaries in images due to our highly evolved visual perception and prior context and understanding of the world. A computer algorithm, in contrast, would identify these edges by identifying changes in contrasts, gradients, colors, etc. within an image, which are represented by different pixel values. Edge Detection has multiple use cases across many domains; for example, Edge Detection can be used to identify land parcel boundaries in satellite imagery."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["<center><img src=\"../../static/img/edge_detection.jpg\"/></center>\n", "<center>Figure 1.

There have been many algorithms in the past that have worked well, to a certain degree, for edge detection. Most of these employed well-researched filters or operators that worked in most cases. The Canny Edge Detection [2] technique has been one of the most popular ones. This technique involves multiple stages, including Gaussian blurring, gradient filtering, non-maxima suppression, etc. Many other techniques use hand-crafted features to detect the edges. Later, algorithms such as Structured Forest for Fast Edge Detection, which use machine learning with hand-crafted features, grew in popularity as they were more accurate and relatively faster than their predecessors[3].\n", "\n", "In the last few years, with advancements in deep learning, many CNN-based models have been developed to solve edge detection problems.

The model has two salient features that give the model its name, according to the authors. First, the model is 'holistic', as it takes an image as input and outputs another image (edge map). The model doesn't require hand-crafted features as inputs, rather, due to its architecture, it creates these features internally in the hidden layers. This property is inherited from the fully-convolutional networks. Second, the model is 'nested' and learns at multiple scales using deep supervised learning. This is achieved by taking side outputs at varying depths [4]."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["<center><img src=\"../../static/img/hed.jpg\"/></center>\n", "<center>Figure 2.

This architecture of HED can be seen in Figure 2. Total loss is the sum of loss calculated at both the fusion layer and the side outputs. The loss function used in the model is the cross-entropy loss with the addition of a class-balancing weight for the side outputs. The class-balancing weight is introduced because the majority of the pixels in an edge map will not represent edges [4]."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["## Bi-Directional Cascade Network for Perceptual Edge Detection (BDCN)"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["BDCN is a relatively recent model that tries to improve the edge detection for images with objects of largely varying scales.

Therefore, it is more optimal if the learning in each layer is focused on a particular scale [1]."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["<center><img src=\"../../static/img/bdcn.jpg\"/></center>\n", "<center>Figure 3.

SEM is made of multiple parallel convolution layers using dilation at different rates to create receptive fields at varying scales. Using dilation is an effective way of creating varying receptive fields without increasing the total parameters. ID Blocks eventually provide two edge predictions, with one propagated from the shallow layer to the deep layer and the other from the deep layer to the shallow layer, thus forming a bi-directional cascade structure.
