    "## The Conda Basics\n",
    "The easiest way to understand conda is by working through the [30-minute Getting Started](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/getting-started.html) tutorial. The sections below summarize and outline the commands you need to know to work with the ArcGIS API for Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda is a platform-independent [package](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/glossary.html#packages) manager application that can install, update, and remove Python packages. Packages are bundles of software and supporting files stored in any of a variety of repositories called [channels](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/glossary.html#channels). Channels may be a default set of cloud locations, such as Anaconda Cloud, or private repositories created by individuals or organizations. Conda searches a default set of channels when listing or installing packages. See [Conda channels](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/channels.html?highlight=channels#) for more information, such as how to configure conda to search specific channels. \n",
    "\n",
    "Esri has created a conda repository at a channel named `esri` to store the `arcgis` package. You can access channels with a flag in the conda install command, and instruct conda to install packages into specific conda [environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/glossary.html#conda-environment). The rest of this document provides basic instructions to work with conda environments and links to resources providing more details.  \n",
    "## Conda Environments\n",
    "When you create conda environments, you create physical directories that isolate the specific Python interpreter and packages you install into the environment. This allows you to create multiple environments that can have different versions of software, including Python. You can easily create new environments and then switch between them without affecting other environments.  For detailed explanation and instructions, see the conda documentation on [Managing environments](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).\n",
