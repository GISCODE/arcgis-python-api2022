# Checklist

- [ ] All `import`s are in the first cell? First block of imports are standard libraries, second block are 3rd party libraries, third block are all `arcgis` imports? Note that in some cases, for samples, it is a good idea to keep the imports next to where they are used, particularly for uncommonly used features that we want to highlight.
- [ ] All `GIS` object instantiations are one of the following?
    - `gis = GIS()`
    - `gis = GIS('home')`
    - `gis = GIS(profile="your_online_portal")`
    - `gis = GIS('https://pythonapi.playground.esri.com/portal')`
    - `gis = GIS(profile="your_enterprise_portal")`
- [ ] If this notebook requires setup or teardown, did you add the appropriate code to `./misc/setup.py` and/or `./misc/teardown.py`?
- [ ] If this notebook references any portal items that need to be staged on AGOL/Python API playground, did you coordinate with a Python API team member to stage the item the correct way with the api\_data\_owner user?
- [ ] Code refactored & split out across multiple cells, useful comments?
- [ ] Consistent voice/tense/narrative style? Thoroughly checked for typos?
- [ ] All images used like `<img src="base64str_here">` instead of `<img src="https://some.url">`? All map widgets contain a static image preview? (Call `mapview_inst.take_screenshot()` to do so)
- [ ] All file paths are constructed in an OS-agnostic fashion with `os.path.join()`? (Instead of `r"\foo\bar"`, `os.path.join(os.path.sep, "foo", "bar")`, etc.)
- [ ] **IF YOU WANT THIS SAMPLE TO BE DISPLAYED ON THE DEVELOPERS.ARCGIS.COM WEBSITE**, ping @ DavidJVitale so he can add it to the list for the next deploy
