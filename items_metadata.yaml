  snippet: Observe spatial and temporal growth trends in construction permits
  description: In this notebook, you'll explore Montgomery County permit data. First, you'll add the permit data from ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World. You'll explore the data and become familiar with exactly what kind of information it contains. Then, you'll analyze the data to detect patterns and find out why growth is occurring. Once you've gathered your findings from your exploration and analysis, you'll share your work online.
