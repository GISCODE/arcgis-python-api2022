    "The network module of the ArcGIS API for Python can be used to solve different types of network analysis operations. For example, an appliance delivery company wants to serve multiple customers in a day using several delivery drivers, a health inspection company needs to schedule inspection visits for the inspectors. The problem that is common to these examples is called vehicle routing problem (VRP). Each such problem requires to determine which orders should be serviced by which vehicle/driver and in what sequence, so the total operating cost is minimized and the routes are operational. In addition, the VRP solver can solve more specific problems because numerous options are available, such as matching vehicle capacities with order quantities, giving breaks to drivers, and pairing orders so they are serviced by the same route.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sample, we find a solution for an appliance delivery company to find routes for two vehicles which start from the warehouse and return to the same, at the end of the working day. We will find optimized routes given a set of orders to serve and a set of vehicles with constraints. All we need to do is pass in the `depot` locations, `route` (vehicle/driver) details, the `order` locations, and specify additional properties for `orders`.  The VRP service will return `routes` with directions. Once you have the results, you can add the `routes` to a map, display the turn-by-turn directions, or integrate them further into your application. To learn more about the capabilities of the routing and directions services, please visit the [documentation](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/extensions/network-analyst/vehicle-routing-problem.htm#)."
